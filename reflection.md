Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
I feel like I have a better understanding of it because of this assignment! If part of my program wasn't working, it was usually because my attributes weren't set correctly to private and my getters weren't set correctly sometimes to public.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
It was confusing to see how the classes interact with eachother at first but I feel like I understand it more now. It was hard to figure out which  method from which class needed to be called on which object. I would tell someone to really focus on using methods from different classes in other classes.
